# This option will default to `true` in RSpec 4. It makes the `description`
# and `failure_message` of custom matchers include text for helper methods
# defined using `chain`, e.g.:
#     be_bigger_than(2).and_smaller_than(4).description
#     # => "be bigger than 2 and smaller than 4"
# ...rather than:
#     # => "be bigger than 2"

# rspec-mocks config goes here. You can use an alternate test double
# library (such as bogus or mocha) by changing the `mock_with` option here.

# Prevents you from mocking or stubbing a method that does not exist on
