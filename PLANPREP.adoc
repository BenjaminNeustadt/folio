{url-exifdata}[Exif Data gem tool]

- ORM: 

{url-sinatra-activerecord}[Sinatra ActiveRecord]

- Testing:

-- RSpec (unit testing)

-- Capybara (end to end testing)

-- Jmeter (for load testing/performance testing)

== Kanban

The kanban board of ongoing tickets can be found {url-trello}[here].

== Ideation

=== Moderation of content

The platform should not rely on any standard KYC processes, that can be
intrusive, and infiringe on privacy of users; nevertheless the issue of
moderating content so as not to host or display morally unsavoury/illegal
content needs to be considered carefully.

"Morally unsavoury content" for now refers to any images which are:

-- pornographic in nature AND contain images of children.

-- containing scenes of extreme violence (e.g. beheadings, non-historical murder scenes etc.)

-- documents that immediately identify any persons who does not hold a position of political authority

The terms are currently vague, though will need to be discussed in greater detail.

In order to not burden one person with the onus of moderating what does and does not constitue a moral transgression according to the rules of the site,
but also to not give one person the power to determine what can and cannot be seen the responsibility should be a collective one. 

==== Sponsorhip link

Therefore, as a temporary solution, users will need to be invited by other users onto the site.
If one person posts anything that transgresses the rules, then two people are banned, the person committing the offence, along with their sponsor.

==== Jury service

If the site begins to host many users, then when content is flagged, members of the collective will be called on to immediately serve in a sort of randomised jury service.
If 100 members are on the site, then 10 users will be shown the image and asked to 'Yay' or 'Nay'.
50% vote either way is required to take action from thereon.
If a draw, another is made of randomised users.

The users should not be subscribers to the person whose content is under review, as this would naturally instill a bias.

If it is 'Nay', a grace period of 20 days is given for the user to appeal to another jury call, before the users profile is deleted.

During the appeal period, and from the moment of flagging, the image in question is obfuscated, but not deleted from the database.


This system will need to be thought through in greater detail.

If the rules are defined well enough, then rather than asking 'Yay' or 'Nay', then it may be easier to ask the jury member:
"Does the following image infringe on the premise of the following rule: Must not depict an image of a child in a sexual context?"
OR
"Does the following image infringe on the premise of the following rule: Must not promote the exclusion or violence towards a person on the basis of their physical appearance?"

If the person that flags the image as infringment reports more than 3 images, that all are deemed 'Yay' by a wider group of deliberators, the reporter is deleted instead.

A qualifying jury member is only someone who is a contributor to the platform. (i.e. hosts a group, hosts images or content online for others to see).
A contributor is someone who has participated in activity, either in sending messages to other users (be they private or public).

=== Communication channel

The wed application should promote free movement and communication of users whether they are on this platform or others.
Therefore, the chat should be federated, so that users can send messages to their friends and colleagues on other platforms.

[insert details on the federated stuff here from convo with KOTP]

== To pay or not to pay

Dependent on the desired outcome, it might be an idea to consider users paying a monthly subscription fee in order to have their images hosted.
The reasonining is simple, hosting images online securely is not free
- as an example there isn't anywhere I can think of where you can go and dump a bag of your belongings and expect them to remain unscathed, unborrowed, unused if you leave them overnight.
Ultimately the same will apply to the internet.

=== Organising code base

Consider Sinatra partials gem: https://github.com/yb66/Sinatra-Partial

https://github.com/rubyconfig/config

=== Extra ideas

Integrate the V&A collection:

Users can browse throught the collection and add items to their favourites...encouraging engagement with the museums collection in an interative way...

The users favourites collection gets added to a map, according to the location it was produced, emphasising the diversity of the museums collection

Users can search for items according to their interests...
